# Phishing-Email-Simulation
A social engineering simulation to raise phishing awareness simulation
This project was designed as part of a cybersecurity training initiative to educate employees on phishing awareness. It involved simulating a phishing attempt to help users identify red flags and better understand social engineering tactics used in the real world.

Objectives

Teach non-technical employees how to spot phishing emails.

Simulate a realistic phishing scenario for internal awareness.

Highlight the importance of scrutinizing email sender details and content.

What I Did

Created a simulated phishing email impersonating Mastercard Customer Support.

Crafted a believable sender address to resemble an official domain, making the email more convincing and testing employee vigilance.

Used social engineering principles (urgency, authority, brand familiarity) to construct the message.

Focused on ethical delivery: no harm, data collection, or malicious payload involvedâ€”purely educational.

Key Learnings

Gained hands-on experience designing realistic but safe phishing simulations.

Learned how to analyze phishing indicators like sender spoofing, urgency tactics, and suspicious links.

Understood how effective training and simulation can empower users to resist cyber threats.

Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational and awareness purposes. It does not involve real phishing or any unauthorized activity. It was conducted in a controlled, ethical environment.
